# Memory Template - Cursor

Create `~/cursor/memory.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Cursor Memory

## Status

status: ongoing version: 1.0.0 last: YYYY-MM-DD integration: pending | done | declined

## Context

<!-- What the user uses Cursor for and why -->
<!-- Example: repo-aware implementation and review with local CLI only, no Background Agents -->

## Activation Boundaries

<!-- When this skill should activate automatically and when it should stay quiet -->

## Repo Defaults

<!-- Approved repos, verification expectations, and git-safety posture -->

## Rules Strategy

<!-- Preferred use of .cursor/rules, repo agent guidance, and legacy cleanup decisions -->

## Privacy and Remote Work

<!-- Indexing, Background Agent, GitHub, Bugbot, and MCP boundaries -->

## Surface Preferences

<!-- Editor Agent, Ask, Manual, custom modes, CLI, Background Agent, Bugbot -->

## Notes

<!-- Durable operational observations worth reusing -->

## Status Values

| Value       | Meaning                                     | Behavior                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ongoing`   | Default learning state                      | Keep refining durable Cursor defaults         |
| `complete`  | Stable surfaces and trust posture are clear | Reuse defaults unless the environment changes |
| `paused`    | User wants less overhead                    | Save only critical changes                    |
| `never_ask` | User rejected persistence                   | Operate statelessly                           |

## Key Principles

- Store workflow boundaries, not full prompts, full diffs, or private transcripts.
- Keep repo approvals, remote-workflow approvals, and MCP approvals explicit.
- Record which Cursor surfaces are preferred and which are prohibited.
- Update `last` on each meaningful Cursor session.
